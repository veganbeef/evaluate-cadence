# evaluate-cadence
This repository contains the Cadence contracts and example transactions for evaluate.xyz's Flow blockchain products, as well as [overflow](https://github.com/bjartek/overflow) tests.
Some transactions and contracts were borrowed from [flow-nft-overflow](https://github.com/bjartek/flow-nft-overflow).

To run tests: `go test ./...`

*TODO: add table with mainnet and testnet deployment addresses*
